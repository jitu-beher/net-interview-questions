**OAuth** and **OpenID Connect** are both protocols related to **authentication** and **authorization** in modern web applications. They are commonly used for securing API access and enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality. While they are often used together, they serve distinct purposes.

### **OAuth (Open Authorization)**

**OAuth** is an **authorization** protocol that allows third-party applications to access a user's resources without exposing their credentials (username/password). Instead of sharing sensitive login information, OAuth allows users to grant access to their resources hosted on one service to another service.

#### How OAuth works:

1. **Authorization Request:** A client (third-party application) requests authorization from the user to access a specific resource (e.g., Google Contacts, Facebook profile).
2. **User Consent:** The user is redirected to the service provider's authorization server, where they log in and consent to the access requested by the client.
3. **Authorization Grant:** If the user grants permission, the authorization server issues an **authorization code**.
4. **Token Exchange:** The client exchanges the authorization code for an **access token** from the authorization server.
5. **Accessing Resources:** The client can now use the access token to access the protected resources on the resource server on behalf of the user.

#### Key Points about OAuth:

- **OAuth is used for authorization**, not authentication.
- It enables **delegated access** (i.e., granting limited access to resources without sharing credentials).
- OAuth access tokens are short-lived and can be refreshed using a refresh token (for long-term access).

OAuth is commonly used in scenarios where applications need to access user data from other services (e.g., Google APIs, Facebook Graph API).

### **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**

**OpenID Connect** (OIDC) is a simple **authentication protocol** built on top of OAuth 2.0. While OAuth is primarily used for **authorization**, OpenID Connect adds an **authentication layer**, allowing applications to verify the identity of users.

OIDC extends OAuth 2.0 by introducing the concept of an **ID token**, which contains information about the user and can be used to authenticate the user.

#### How OpenID Connect works:

1. **Authentication Request:** The client (application) sends a request to the OpenID Connect Provider (e.g., Google, Microsoft) to authenticate the user.
2. **User Consent:** The user logs in (via OAuth, if necessary) and grants consent to share their identity.
3. **ID Token:** The provider sends back an **ID token** (a JWT - JSON Web Token) that contains user identity information like name, email, and profile details.
4. **Access Token:** Along with the ID token, an access token may also be issued for authorization (to access protected resources).
5. **User Info Endpoint:** The client can query a user info endpoint to get more details about the user.

#### Key Points about OpenID Connect:

- **OIDC is used for authentication**, verifying the identity of the user.
- It extends OAuth 2.0 by providing **ID tokens**, which include user identity information.
- OIDC allows applications to authenticate users using a third-party identity provider (e.g., Google, Microsoft).
- It also provides a **standardized way** to retrieve user profile information through the user info endpoint.

### **Comparison between OAuth and OpenID Connect:**

| Feature                  | **OAuth 2.0**                       | **OpenID Connect**                                |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**              | Authorization (access to resources) | Authentication (verifying identity)               |
| **Primary Token**        | Access Token (for authorization)    | ID Token (for authentication) + Access Token      |
| **Identity Information** | No identity info in the token       | Identity info in the ID Token (e.g., name, email) |
| **Protocol**             | OAuth 2.0                           | OAuth 2.0 with additional features                |
| **Use Case**             | Granting access to resources        | Verifying the user's identity                     |

### **When to Use OAuth vs. OpenID Connect:**

- **Use OAuth** when you want to allow third-party applications to access resources on behalf of the user without exposing their credentials (e.g., accessing a userâ€™s Google Drive files via a third-party app).
- **Use OpenID Connect** when you need to authenticate a user and retrieve their identity information (e.g., allowing users to log in to your application using their Google or Facebook account).

### **Example Scenario:**

- **OAuth Example**: A user logs in to a photo editing app using their Google account to access and edit photos stored in Google Drive.
- **OpenID Connect Example**: A user logs in to a website using their Google account, and the website uses the ID token to authenticate the user and provide personalized content.

### **Conclusion:**

- **OAuth** handles **authorization**, allowing apps to request access to user data without needing their credentials.
- **OpenID Connect** handles **authentication**, allowing apps to verify the identity of users and authenticate them using external identity providers.

Together, OAuth and OpenID Connect allow for secure and seamless access to user data while protecting privacy and providing Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities.
