Here are some common C# interview questions along with brief explanations of each:

### 1. **What is the difference between `==` and `Equals()` in C#?**

- `==` compares references (for reference types) or values (for value types), while `Equals()` is a method that is used to compare objects for equality, considering their actual content.

### 2. **What is a value type and a reference type?**

- **Value Type:** Contains the data directly. Examples: `int`, `float`, `struct`.
- **Reference Type:** Contains a reference to the data. Examples: `string`, `class`, `array`.

### 3. **Explain the concept of `boxing` and `unboxing`.**

- **Boxing:** Converting a value type to a reference type. For example, converting an `int` to `object`.
- **Unboxing:** Converting a reference type back to a value type. This requires an explicit cast.

### 4. **What are delegates in C#?**

- A delegate is a type-safe function pointer. It represents a method with a specific parameter list and return type.

### 5. **What is a `static` class?**

- A `static` class cannot be instantiated and can only contain static members. It is used to group related utility methods, constants, or other functionality.

### 6. **What are the differences between `String` and `StringBuilder`?**

- **String:** Immutable (cannot be modified after creation). Each modification creates a new string.
- **StringBuilder:** Mutable and efficient for repeated string manipulations, as it does not create new objects on each modification.

### 7. **What is inheritance and how does it work in C#?**

- Inheritance allows a class to inherit methods and properties from another class (the base class). This promotes code reusability and hierarchical classification of classes.

### 8. **What are `abstract` classes and `interfaces` in C#?**

- **Abstract Class:** Cannot be instantiated and may contain both abstract (unimplemented) and concrete (implemented) methods.
- **Interface:** Contains only method signatures and constants; cannot contain any implementation. A class implements an interface.

### 9. **What are the access modifiers in C#?**

- `public`, `private`, `protected`, `internal`, `protected internal`, and `private protected` are used to control the visibility of members and classes.

### 10. **What is a `sealed` class?**

- A `sealed` class cannot be inherited. It prevents other classes from deriving from it.

### 11. **What is dependency injection (DI)?**

- DI is a design pattern where an object receives its dependencies from an external source (e.g., constructor injection, property injection) rather than creating them internally.

### 12. **What is LINQ and how does it work in C#?**

- LINQ (Language Integrated Query) allows you to query collections (arrays, lists, etc.) in a declarative way using C# syntax.

### 13. **What is the difference between `IEnumerable` and `IEnumerator`?**

- **IEnumerable:** Represents a collection that can be iterated over with a `foreach` loop.
- **IEnumerator:** Provides the mechanism to iterate through a collection, including methods like `MoveNext()` and `Current`.

### 14. **What is the `using` statement in C#?**

- The `using` statement is used for managing resources, ensuring that IDisposable objects (like file streams or database connections) are properly disposed of when done.

### 15. **What are `events` in C#?**

- An event is a way to provide notifications to other objects about some occurrence. Events are based on delegates and are used for implementing the observer pattern.

### 16. **What is garbage collection in C#?**

- Garbage collection is the process by which the .NET runtime automatically reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. The garbage collector (GC) runs in the background to clean up memory.

### 17. **What is the difference between `ref` and `out` parameters in C#?**

- **`ref`:** The parameter must be initialized before passing it to the method.
- **`out`:** The parameter does not need to be initialized before passing it; the method is expected to assign it a value.

### 18. **What are async and await in C#?**

- `async` is used to mark a method as asynchronous, and `await` is used to pause the execution of an asynchronous method until the task is complete, allowing for non-blocking calls.

### 19. **What is a `constructor` in C#?**

- A constructor is a special method that is called when an instance of a class is created. It is used to initialize objects.

### 20. **Explain the difference between `Task` and `Thread`.**

- **Task:** Represents an asynchronous operation that is part of the Task Parallel Library (TPL). It is more efficient and easier to use than manually managing threads.
- **Thread:** Represents a separate path of execution in a program, requiring manual management for synchronization.
